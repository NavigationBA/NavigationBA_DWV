Speaking of real time, we thought of one more opportunity. We read in the Times that Air London is adding in flight Internet seatback capabilities.</p> <p>Chi (BSI): Our idea is to use pop up screens to interact with impacted customers, giving them options and gathering information. The system would interact with them in priority order based on the rebooking scoring. For example, we might find out that our top priority passenger, Conrad, would have been happy to take the flight to London around noon the next day.</p> <p> </p> <p>Matt (BSI): That freed up a seat.

There is a monthly review meeting held between A&amp;F and the managers responsible for each budget.</p> <p>The Head of A&amp;F tells you that it is critical to be able to identify as early as possible any major budget overruns. The process to approve increases to budgets is a long one and requires many approvals. In the case where approval is not granted, it is important that other departments are advised to prioritize only essential expenditures and defer discretionary ones.</p> <p>You have been provided a screenshot of the current reporting dashboard, implemented with Microsoft PowerBI software. You have also come to learn that the current process to prepare for the monthly meeting has several problems. Updating the dashboard is time consuming and error prone. First, reports from the accounting system (Oracle Financials, a web browser-based application) are generated for each budget. These are then exported into Excel files. The exports must then be edited (there are many lines with extra headings, empty rows, sub-totals, and totals that must be deleted), then combined manually (copy/paste with additional columns added to identify which budget etc.) into a single Excel file. Several embarrassing mistakes have been made in the past where data was missing or misaligned to the wrong budget. To make matters worse the key analyst who was responsible for doing this each month has resigned and moved on. However, the Head of A&amp;F sees this as something of an opportunity to perhaps rethink the reporting process and hire somebody with relevant skills to implement and maintain the changed process. Ideally, they\u2019d like the new process to be as automated as possible to prevent mistakes, but also to save time.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"Practice/Topic02/Practice02_02/Practice02_02/#evaluation-checklist","title":"Evaluation Checklist:","text":""},{"location":"Practice/Topic02/Practice02_02/Practice02_02/#1","title":"(1)","text":"<p>Q: Briefly describe the strengths of the design of this dashboard.</p> <p>A:</p> <p>Strength:</p> <ul> <li>The plots basically provides enough information for analytical purposes, which essentially shows the classification of the budget and its usage.</li> <li>The overall format is clear without over decoration or over formatting - no 3D charts, no icons, and no boarders.

The pie charts for budget breakdowns and the stepped bar chart for O&amp;M Expenditures should not be used, which are inefficient in comparing values. The single value donut chart is also not appropriate, which has lower information delivery utility and causes waste of space.</li> <li>Some texts are not clear. The titles of all plots and KPIs are smaller in fonts, and the labels in pie charts are truncated. Also, many of the terms in the text are jargon and are not clearly explained, e.g., \u201c101\u201d, \u201c102\u201d, \u201c280\u201d.</li> <li>The titles of pie charts and bar charts are vague without specifying analytical scope, and period. </li> <li>The data in bar charts are percentage rather than raw data - this is over computation. Also, labeling every data in the bar charts is not necessary, which is duplicated with axis.

The detailed breakdown of these three categories can be shown in a bar chart, with categories and bars ranked by value. Also, the monthly changes of these three categories can be shown in a line chart, with label showing the ending value of each series. Furthermore, the expenses and forecasts relative to budget can be shown in a bullet chart, with bars showing actual and forecast expenses and outlines showing budget - it should be immediately clear whether the budget has been exceeded.
